# 404

**Indicates that the page requested can't be found.**

## Overview

The **404** component is a page that indicates that the user reached the domain they requested but the URL path provided no information.

The component consists of an illustration, an emoticon of a person shrugging, and a message indicating the invalid address that should also guide the user to a valid page on the site.

## Guidelines

- If a custom message is not passed, then the default message is displayed with a link to the home page.
