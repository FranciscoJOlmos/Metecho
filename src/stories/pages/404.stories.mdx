# 404

**Indicates that the page requested can't be found.**

## Overview

The **404** component is a page that indicates that the user reached the domain they requested but the URL path provided no information.

The component consists of an illustration, an emoticon of a person shrugging, and a message indicating the invalid address that should also guide the user to a valid page on the site.

Typically, a `message` would be passed at the instance to provide meaningful information on how to recover from an error, for example, navigating to an `epic` or `task` that doesn't exist.

## Guidelines

<Story id="pages-404-component--four-oh-four" />

If a custom message is not passed, then the default message is displayed with a link to the home page.

<Story id="pages-404-component--empty-four-oh-four" />
