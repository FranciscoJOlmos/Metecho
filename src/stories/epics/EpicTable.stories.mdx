## About

**Epics** are bodies of work that are large enough to be broken down to a number of smaller **tasks** within a given **project**.

The **EpicTable** renders an [SLDS DataTable](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/data-tables/) accepting an `epic` as the collection of items to render in the table. This allows users to view a list of epics and it's related information created within a given task.
