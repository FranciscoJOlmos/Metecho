## Overview

**Epics** are bodies of work that are large enough to be broken down to a number
of smaller **tasks** within a given **project**.

The **EpicTable** renders an [SLDS
DataTable](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/data-tables/)
accepting a collection of `epics` to render in the table. This allows users to
view a list of epics and their related information created within a given
project.
