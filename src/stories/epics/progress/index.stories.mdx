# Epic Progress

**Visualize the overall progress/status of the entire project.**

## Overview

The **Epic Progress** component provides a quick view of the progress when
viewing a project.

## Guidelines

It accepts a `range` (`[number, number]`) with the first number representing the
number of tasks in a project with a `Completed` status, and the second represents the total
number of project tasks.

  <EpicProgress range={[7, 13]} />
</Canvas>

When all the tasks in a project are complete, we've added a <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/progress-bar/#Modifiers">color modifier </a>to the underlyning progress bar.

<Canvas>
  <EpicProgress range={[10, 10]} />
