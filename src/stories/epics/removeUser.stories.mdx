**Confirms removal of a user from an Epic.**

## Overview

The **RemoveUser** component is a modal used to confirm the removal of a user
from an **Epic** even though that user has a **Task** assigned to them.

Pressing the `Confirm` button closes the modal and removes the user from the
**Epic**. Pressing `Cancel` closes the modal.
