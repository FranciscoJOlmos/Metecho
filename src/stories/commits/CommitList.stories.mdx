# CommitList

**Shows a history of changes to a project.**

## Overview

The **CommitList** component is a data table that shows the GitHub commit history of a project. This makes it possible to see at a glance how a project has changed over time.

Each commit in the list features an id number, an image of the commit author, the commit message, and a timestamp of when the commit was made.
