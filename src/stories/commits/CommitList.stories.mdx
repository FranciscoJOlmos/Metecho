# CommitList

**Shows a history of changes on a task.**

## Overview

The **CommitList** component is a data table that shows the GitHub commit
history of a **task**. This makes it possible to see at a glance how a task has
changed over time.

Each commit in the list features an id number, an image of the commit author,
the commit message, and a timestamp of when the commit was made.
