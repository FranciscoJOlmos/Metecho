# Steps

**Show collaborators what to do next.**

## Overview

The _steps_ component is a helpful piece of UI to let collaborators know what
completion.

It renders Metecho-flavored vertical SLDS Path with toned down colors as to not
draw user's attention away from more important pieces of information on the
page.

Steps can optionally:

- Display the avatar of assigned user. This is helpful to highlight whom the
  step concerns.

- Have a link of button to perform the actions needed for an active step.
