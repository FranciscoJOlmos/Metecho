Development Setup
=================

Cloning the project
-------------------

::

    git clone git@github.com:SFDO-Tooling/metashare
    cd metashare

Docker-based development (preferred)
------------------------------------

1. Install `Docker Desktop (Community Edition)`_ and make sure it is running.

2. Create an ``.env`` file with the required environment variables, set
   per "Making a virtual env" below::

   DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=...
   DJANGO_HASHID_SALT=...
   DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=...
   BUCKETEER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
   BUCKETEER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
   BUCKETEER_BUCKET_NAME=...

3. Run ``docker-compose build`` to build/re-build all the container images.

4. Run ``docker-compose up`` to start the server(s).

5. Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

6. When you're done with that, just Ctrl-C in the terminal where the
   containers are running. You can also ``docker-compose down`` to clean
   up all running containers. (``docker-compose ps`` will tell you what
   containers are currently running.)

Docker development tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run any development tasks (such as changing Python or JS
dependencies, or generating or running migrations, or running a Django
shell), you will need to run them inside the appropriate Docker image.
This takes the general form ``docker-compose run --no-deps [web or
client] [command]``. In some cases, such as for migrations or a Django
shell, you will want to omit the ``--no-deps`` flag.

You shouldn't need to run any of the setup tasks you need in the
locally-running variant; the Docker images will take care of setting up
a database and installing Python and JS dependencies for you.

When you change Python or JS dependencies, you will need to rebuild the
Docker images, as we store dependencies in the images for speed. This
requires running ``docker-compose build [web or client]``.

Tests and linting can be run similarly::

    docker-compose run --no-deps client yarn prettier
    docker-compose run --no-deps client yarn eslint
    docker-compose run --no-deps client yarn test

    docker-compose run --no-deps web black manage.py metashare/ config/
    docker-compose run --no-deps web isort -rc manage.py metashare/ config/
    docker-compose run --no-deps web flake8 manage.py metashare/ config/
    docker-compose run web pytest

Locally-running development (dispreferred)
------------------------------------------

Making a virtual env
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MetaShare development requires Python v3.7. If ``which python3.7`` returns a
non-empty path, it's already installed and you can continue to the next step. If
it returns nothing, then install Python v3.7 using ``brew install python``, or
from `Python.org`_.

.. _Python.org: https://www.python.org/downloads/

There are a variety of tools that let you set up environment variables
temporarily for a particular "environment" or directory. We use
`virtualenvwrapper`_. Assuming you're in the repo root, do the following to
create a virtualenv (once you have `virtualenvwrapper`_ installed locally)::

    mkvirtualenv metashare --python=$(which python3.7)
    setvirtualenvproject

Install Python requirements::

    pip install pipenv
    pipenv install --dev

Copy the ``.env`` file somewhere that will be sourced when you need it::

    cp env.example $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate

Edit this file to change ``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`` and ``DJANGO_HASHID_SALT`` to any
two different arbitrary string values. Also set ``DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY``::

    python
    from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
    Fernet.generate_key()

This will output a bytestring, e.g. ``b'mystring='``. Copy just the contents of
``'...'``, e.g. ``export DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY='mystring='``.

Finally, add the following environment variables::

    export BUCKETEER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
    export BUCKETEER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
    export BUCKETEER_BUCKET_NAME=...

Now run ``workon metashare`` again to set those environment variables.

Your ``PATH`` (and environment variables) will be updated when you
``workon metashare`` and restored when you ``deactivate``. This will make sure
that whenever you are working on the project, you use the project-specific version of Node
instead of any system-wide Node you may have.

**All of the remaining steps assume that you have the virtualenv activated.**
(``workon metashare``)

.. _virtualenvwrapper: https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Installing JavaScript requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project-local version of `Node.js`_ can be downloaded and unpacked locally
(in the git-ignored ``node/`` directory), so you don't have to install it
system-wide (and possibly conflict with other projects wanting other Node
versions).

To download and install the project-local version of Node (and `yarn`_)::

    bin/unpack-node

If you can run ``which node`` and see a path inside your project directory ending with
``.../node/bin/node``, then you've got it set up right and can move on.

Then use ``yarn`` to install dependencies::

    yarn

.. _Node.js: http://nodejs.org
.. _yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/

Setting up the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming you have `Postgres <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>`_ installed
and running locally::

    createdb metashare

Then run the initial migrations::

    python manage.py migrate

Running the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The local development server requires `Redis <https://redis.io/>`_ to manage
background worker tasks. If you can successfully run ``redis-cli ping`` and see
output ``PONG``, then you have Redis installed and running. Otherwise, run
``brew install redis`` (followed by ``brew services start redis``) or refer to
the `Redis Quick Start`_.

To run the local development server::

    yarn serve

The running server will be available at `<http://localhost:8080/>`_.

.. _Redis Quick Start: https://redis.io/topics/quickstart

Logging in with Salesforce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To setup the Salesforce OAuth integration, run the ``populate_social_apps``
management command. The values to use in place of the ``XXX`` and ``YYY`` flags
can be found on the Connected App you've made in your Salesforce configuration::

    python manage.py populate_social_apps --prod-id XXX --prod-secret YYY

You can also run it with ``--test-id`` and ``--test-secret``, or
``--cust-id`` and ``--cust-secret``, or all three sets at once, to
populate all three providers.

Once you've logged in, you probably want to make your user a superuser.
You can do that easily via the ``promote_superuser`` management
command::

    python manage.py promote_superuser <your email>

Development Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``yarn serve``: starts development server (with watcher) at
  `<http://localhost:8080/>`_ (assets are served from ``dist/`` dir)
- ``yarn pytest``: run Python tests
- ``yarn test``: run JS tests
- ``yarn test:watch``: run JS tests with a watcher for development
- ``yarn lint``: formats and lints ``.scss`` and ``.js`` files; lints ``.py``
  files
- ``yarn prettier``: formats ``.scss`` and ``.js`` files
- ``yarn eslint``: lints ``.js`` files
- ``yarn flow``: runs JS type-checking
- ``yarn stylelint``: lints ``.scss`` files
- ``yarn flake8``: lints ``.py`` files
- ``yarn build``: builds development (unminified) static assets into ``dist/``
  dir
- ``yarn prod``: builds production (minified) static assets into ``dist/prod/``
  dir

In commit messages or pull request titles, we use the following emojis to label
which development commands need to be run before serving locally (these are
automatically prepended to commit messages):

- ðŸ“¦ (``:package:``) -> ``pipenv install --dev``
- ðŸ›¢ (``:oil_drum:``) -> ``python manage.py migrate``
- ðŸ§¶ (``:yarn:``) -> ``yarn``

Internationalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build and compile ``.mo`` and ``.po`` files for the backend, run::

   $ python manage.py makemessages --locale <locale>
   $ python manage.py compilemessages

These commands require the `GNU gettext toolset`_ (``brew install gettext``).

For the front-end, translation JSON files are served from
``locales/<language>/`` directories, and the `user language is auto-detected at
runtime`_.

During development, strings are parsed automatically from the JS, and an English
translation file is auto-generated to ``locales_dev/en/translation.json`` on
every build (``yarn build`` or ``yarn serve``). When this file changes,
translations must be copied over to the ``locales/en/translation.json`` file in
order to have any effect.

Strings with dynamic content (i.e. known only at runtime) cannot be
automatically parsed, but will log errors while the app is running if they're
missing from the served translation files. To resolve, add the missing key:value
translations to ``locales/<language>/translation.json``.
